# "ToDo API" Microservice Tools as Dependencies

Although not required I encourage you to install [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to keep your tools _"sandboxed"_, that way in case your use case requires it, you can install different versions of the same tool on different projects.

For installing tools I use the [_Tools as Dependencies_](https://github.com/go-modules-by-example/index/blob/master/010_tools/README.md) paradigm using Go modules, if you installed `direnv` you can execute [`install_tools`](bin/install_tools) directly to download and install the required packages.
