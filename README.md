# Microservice Example

Welcome! This is an educational microservice used as the principal example of my video series: [Building Microservices in Go/Golang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yAAGMOat_Fn8sAXIk0WyBfK_sT1pohu).

It's a collection of patterns and guidelines I've successfully used to deliver enterprise microservices when using Go.

The whole purpose of this project is to give you an idea about structing your project to last for years, to allow your team to collaborate efficiently with little friction and more importantly to have a your code as idiomatic as possible.
